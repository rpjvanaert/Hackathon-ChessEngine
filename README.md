# Scope of Hackathon
You have absolute freedom to modify and improve the chess engine in any way you see fit, but there are some restrictions.

Restrictions:
- Must be based on this codebase (java 17, maven).
- Must be single threaded: no threads created or parallelism.
- No external sources allowed, including API's, pre-trained models, developed engines, etc. 
 
Have fun and be creative!

# Use of Repository
Everything to develop this chess engine.
Prerequisites:
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- Git

## Setup
1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Clone the [KnightClubbingLogic repository](https://github.com/rpjvanaert/KnightClubbingLogic#)
3. Build KnightClubbingLogic and install it to your local maven repository:
```
mvn clean install
```
4. Build the base version of this repository:
```
mvn clean package
```
5. Copy the generated jar to the `test-sprt/engines` directory. Copy it again and remove the '-SNAPSHOT' from the name.
6. Run the SPRT tests to make sure everything is working:
```shell
docker compose up --build
# or
podman compose up --build
```
7. Once you see matches running and results, you can stop the containers. You are ready to begin!

## Workflow engine development
1. Make sure you have a base version built and working with SPRT tests. (see above)
2. Make your changes to the engine.
3. Build the new version and copy the jar to the `test-sprt/engines` directory. 
4. Make sure the docker-compose.yml points to the correct version-tags, first one to the base- and second to change version, see [sprt test paramaters](#test_sprtsh-parameters).
5. Run the SPRT tests to see if it improved the engine. See [Using SPRT tests](#using-sprt-tests) for instructions.
6. If it improved, commit the changes.

## Repository structure
Repository can be divided into two main parts: engine code and sprt folder.
### Engine code
The engine code is in the `src` folder. Within is a standard maven structure, it contains:
- `App.java`: Application start point.*
- `Uci.java`: UCI protocol implementation run by App.*
- `EngineConst.java`: Constants used in the engine.
- `search`: folder for search
- `evaluation`: folder for evaluation
- `ordering`: folder for move ordering

\* = For hackathon, you should probably not change these.

### SPRT folder
The `test-sprt` folder contains everything related to the SPRT testing of the engine. For use see [SPRT testing](#sprt-testing) section.
- `engines`: folder for testing engine jars, copy yours here.
- `test_sprt.sh`: script to run the SPRT tests.*
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile to build the image for testing.*
- `docker-compose.yml`: Compose file to spin up testing environment. You can adjust [parameters](#test_sprtsh-parameters) when testing different versions.
- `sprt_presests.ini`: Presets for SPRT test configs.*
- `output/games.pgn`: Output file for games played after running SPRT tests.

# Development
The goal of this hackathon is to learn chess engine development and have fun improving the engine.
## Guidelines
In order to decide what to implement in your engine, I recommend you do it step by step and slowly challenge yourself more.
<br/>
To categorize the steps there are: fundamental, intermediate and advanced steps.
### Fundamental
- Material evaluation
- Piece-square tables (PST)
- MVV-LVA ordering
- Promotions ordering

### Intermediate
- Pawn structure evaluation*
- Killer moves
- Quiescence search
- Mobility
- Other evaluation *
  - Bishop pair
  - King safety
  - etc.

\* = Can become too much or too complex, do basic implementation.

### Advanced
- Principal Variation (PV) move ordering
- Transposition table
- History heuristic
- Null move pruning
- Late move reductions (LMR)

- Google for topics you want to understand better
- LLM's can be helpful to understand concepts. Don't copy or trust them blindly.

## SPRT testing
SPRT tests are used to see if your changes improved the engine or not.
It runs games between base and new version until conclusion is reached.

### Using SPRT tests
To run the SPRT tests, first build the engine jar you want to test. 
Make sure both base and new version jars are in the `test-sprt/engines` directory.
Then run the docker compose setup to execute the tests. 
By default, it will run the test_sprt.sh script with '1.0' as base version and '1.0-SNAPSHOT' as new version.
If you built different versions, change the parameters accordingly in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Also see `test-sprt/test_sprt.sh` for details.

Rebuild image to pick up the engines:
```shell
docker compose up --build
# or podman:
podman compose up --build
```
- H0 accepted: The new version is not better than the base version.
- H1 accepted: The new version is better than the base version.
- LOS: Likelihood of superiority of new over base version.

#### test_sprt.sh parameters
The docker image runs the `test_sprt.sh` as entrypoint with 3 parameters:
- $1: Base engine version (tag of the jar without .jar, f.e. '1.0')
- $2: New engine version (see above)
- $3: sprt_presets.ini preset name (default: 'default')

In the docker-compose.yml file you can change these parameters.
